About
=====

A tool to autogenerate documentation for github pages from markdown and code
documentation generators.  The aim is to make it stupidly easy to have docs
autogenerated from code repositories by adding a config file and a teamcity
build.

The markdown files in master should reflect docs in progress.  We should trigger
the documentation push to run when master is tagged (i.e. the project is released)

As a proof of concept i will get it working with my nodejs projects which already
have markdown docs and docco generated code documentation.  It should be easily
extensible to other projects so the c# wrapper seems sensible next.

Rationale:  It should be stupidly simple and runnable from teamcity.  I've had
a look at a bunch of static site generators (including jekyll, wheat and docpad)
but they all seem to chuck in the kitchen sink.  We don't need multiple layouts,
multiple parsing engines, bundled http server, sitemaps or any of that stuff.

Project Specififc Documentation
-------------------------------

* Generate Github Pages Documentation From Markdown
* It should seamlessly support linking between markdown files which works both
in master branch and in the generated html docs
* Configurable layout and css
* Auto commit and push to github
* Configurable by doccit.rc file or commandline parameters to override
 * Default to look in the docs folder of a repository for markdown files
 * Run a user configurable command to generate code docs
 * Configure paths to documentation

Organisation Documentation
--------------------------

* Pull all public projects in from github API to generate an index
* It must be opt-in.  We could check for doccit enabled projects by looking for
the doccit.rc file in the root of all public projects.
* Spit out classes for different languages.  To enable styling.
* Do all the same markdown static site generation as the project specific
functionality.

Other Ideas
-----------

* Historical documentation navigation by tag.
* Use [this pull request](https://github.com/jashkenas/docco/pull/28) to apply
custom css to the docco generated nodejs docs.
