About
=====

A tool to autogenerate documentation for github pages from markdown and code
documentation generators.  The aim is to make it stupidly easy to have docs
autogenerated from code repositories by adding a config file and a teamcity
build.

The markdown files in master should reflect docs in progress.  We should trigger
the documentation push to run when master is tagged (i.e. the project is released)

As a proof of concept I will get it working with my nodejs projects which already
have markdown docs and docco generated code documentation.  It should be easily
extensible to other projects so the c# wrapper seems sensible next.

Rationale:  It should be stupidly simple and runnable from teamcity.  I really 
don't want to add this into the rake scripts. I've had a look at a bunch of static 
site generators (including jekyll, wheat and docpad) but they all seem to chuck 
in the kitchen sink.  We don't need multiple layouts, multiple parsing engines, 
bundled http server, sitemaps or any of that stuff.

Project Specififc Documentation
-------------------------------

* Generate Github Pages Documentation From Markdown
* It should seamlessly support linking between markdown files which works both
in master branch and in the generated html docs
* Configurable layout and css
* Generate and format a changelog using git-shortlog
* Auto commit and push to github
* Configurable by doccitrc file or commandline parameters to override
 * Default to look in the docs folder of a repository for markdown files
 * Run a user configurable command to generate code docs (e.g. docco / nocco)
 * Configure paths to documentation

Organisation Documentation
--------------------------

* Pull all public projects in from github API to generate an index
* It must be opt-in.  We could check for doccit enabled projects by looking for
the doccitrc file in the root of all public projects, but it may be preferable
just to check for a gh-pages branch as that would not tie people unnecesarily
to this tool.
* Spit out classes for different project programming languages to enable styling.
* Do all the same markdown static site generation as the project specific
functionality.

To Rebase or not to rebase
--------------------------

It's often [recommended](http://get.inject.io/n/XxsZ6RE7) to just rebase
the gh-pages branch off master. I don't want to do that as it would be preferable
for the gh-pages branch to have a log which reflects only commits to the branch
for release documentation.  I'd also like more flexibility in what gets included
in the branch.

Other Ideas
-----------

* Historical documentation navigation by tag.
* Use [this pull request](https://github.com/jashkenas/docco/pull/28) to apply
custom css to the docco generated nodejs docs.
* It might be nice to automate the fiddly clean way of setting up a gh-pages
branch.
* Read package.json for the license and autogenerate a license page.  Add a
config value to the doccitrc for non-nodejs projects.
* Configurable project logo path in the doccitrc for displaying in the index on
the organisation page.

Implementation Notes
--------------------

* It must be runnable from both linux and windows build agents, so that rules
out bash scripts, batch files, or Makefiles.
* It will presumably need some scratch / temp area for checking out the master
and gh-pages branches and comitting / pushing.  That path should be configurable.
* It will probably be written in nodejs or ruby as they have plenty of nice CLI
support libraries, git and github wrappers and it's easy to test and shell out
child processes.
